# Web Sentiment Analyzer

Project Overview  
This is a powerful web app that performs sentiment analysis on user-provided text data. Using advanced NLP techniques and machine learning models, it classifies sentiments into positive, negative, or neutral categories. Whether you're analyzing product reviews, social media comments, or any text data, this tool helps you get quick, accurate insights into people's opinions.

Built with Python and Flask, the app provides a simple interface to input text and instantly get sentiment predictions. It uses libraries like scikit-learn and pandas for data processing and model building, making the backend super efficient and easy to maintain.
